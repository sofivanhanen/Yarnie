# Yarnie
An Android app for solving yarn related problems. For a school course called Algorithms and Data Structures, in winter/spring of 2018 - though even if it was a school project, it's totally usable and useful, if you're into yarn like me.

I'm using the knapsack algorithm to figure out what patterns I should knit to most efficiently use up all of my yarn.
In the app, the user inserts the amount of yarn they have (in yards or meters) and the weight (yarn slang for thickness) of the yarn, and whether the app should prioritize free/new/popular patterns.
The app then connects to the Ravelry API to acces their database of thousands of knitting and crochet patterns,
searches for a set of the right kind of patterns, runs them through the algorithm, and displays the final list of
suggested patterns.

Includes two different implementations of the knapsack algorithm. Thorougly tested as per course guidelines. Find pictures / graphs / info in Finnish in the TIRALABRA folder.
