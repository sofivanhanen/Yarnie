# Yarnie
An Android app for solving yarn related problems. For a school course called Algorithms and Data Structures.

I'm using the knapsack algorithm to figure out what patterns I should knit to most efficiently use up all of my yarn.
In the app, the user inserts the amount of yarn they have (in yards) and the weight (yarn slang for thickness) of the yarn.
The app then connects to the Ravelry API to acces their database of thousands of knitting and crochet patterns,
searches for a set of the right kind of patterns, runs them through the algorithm, and displays the final list of
suggested patterns.
